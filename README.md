A Quasar Framework app

## Install the dependencies
```bash
yarn install or npm install
```

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)

```

### Replace .env.dev and .env with:
```
BASE_API_PATH=http://api.spaceriders.io:81
ENV=testnet
```

### Request ticket NFT
1. Have metamask installed
2. Have an address ready
3. Have BSC Testnet network configured in metamask, follow instructions: https://medium.com/spartanprotocol/how-to-connect-metamask-to-bsc-testnet-7d89c111ab2
4. Get some testnet BNB (needed to do transactions), put in the field your metamask address: https://testnet.binance.org/faucet-smart, click: "Give me BNB"
5. Ask main devs to give you a ticket NFT - send your address to main dev and he will mint you a ticket
6. At this point, once you have the ticket, you should be able to access the game.
